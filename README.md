# BetterMati.org

A civic-tech initiative providing transparent access to municipal services, programs, and public funds of LGU Mati, Davao Oriental, Philippines.

> ### ⚠️ Placeholders to fill with real City of Mati data
>
> This site was adapted from a template originally built for LGU Solano. All branding, geography (coordinates recentered on Mati, `PH-DAO`), terminology (City / Sangguniang Panlungsod), and the domain (`bettermati.org`) have been rebranded. The following LGU-specific content is **placeholder / draft** and must be replaced with verified data before going live:
>
> - **Elected officials** — `data/officials.json`, `web/src/lib/govDirectory.ts`, `web/src/pages/Government.tsx`, `web/src/pages/GovernmentOfficials.tsx` (mayor, vice mayor, and SP members shown as `[to be confirmed]` / `[Name]` placeholders).
> - **Barangays** — Mati has **26 barangays**. Names live in `web/src/lib/statsData.ts` (`barangayData`) and the canonical reference layer under `data/mati/`. Verify any common-word names (e.g. Roxas, Quezon, Concepcion, San Juan, San Luis, Poblacion) against Mati's actual barangays.
> - **Statistics** — population, land area, density, income class, historical trends, CMCI scores, poverty and economic figures live in `web/src/lib/statsData.ts`, `data/demographics.json`, and `data/competitive-index.json`; several are drafts pending verification (e.g. the `588.63 km²` land area is flagged **NEEDS VERIFICATION**).
> - **Legislation & projects** — `data/resolutions.json`, `data/ordinances.json`, `data/dpwh-projects.json`, and `web/src/lib/{dpwhData,infrastructureData,legislativeProcess}.ts` are reduced to labeled placeholders.
> - **City history** — the homepage timeline (`web/src/pages/Home.tsx` + `home-history-*` keys in `web/src/locales/*.json`) is placeholdered; add verified City of Mati history.
> - **Contact & hotlines** — phone/hotline numbers (`web/src/lib/hotlines.ts`, `web/src/components/layout/HotlineBar.tsx`) use Davao Oriental's `(087)` area code but are placeholder subscriber numbers; emails use `@mati.gov.ph` / `cityofmati` addresses; postal code `8200`. Replace with real values.
> - **Config** — Google Analytics ID is a placeholder; set your GA4 property. Confirm the `mati.gov.ph` domain and official Facebook page.
> - **Artwork** — `assets/images/logo/*`, `favicon.*`, and the OpenGraph banner still carry some template/Solano artwork; the footer white logo (`better-mati-logo-white.svg`) still shows "Better Solano" and needs a real white Mati mark.
> - **Cebuano (`ceb`)** — `web/src/locales/ceb.json` is a machine-assisted starter set only; the bulk of keys fall back to English pending a full translation + native review.

## Architecture

The project is a **single Vite + React SSG application** living in [`web/`](web/), plus a set
of **static passthrough** files at the repo root that the build merges into the final output.

- **`web/`** — the entire site: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui. Every route
  is statically prerendered to HTML by `vite-react-ssg`. The set of routes to prerender is the
  single source of truth in [`web/migrated-routes.json`](web/migrated-routes.json).
- **Root static passthrough** — `assets/` (images), `data/` (JSON content feeds), `admin/`
  (news editor), `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `.htaccess`, `offline.html`, and the
  `403/404/500.html` error pages. These are served as-is and layered into `dist/` at build time.
- **`build.sh`** (run via `npm run build` at the repo root) — builds the `web/` app, assembles
  the prerendered HTML + hashed assets (`/_app/*`) together with the root passthrough into
  **`dist/`**, folderizes parent routes to avoid Apache directory shadowing, and sets cPanel
  file permissions. Deploy the contents of `dist/` to `public_html/`.
- **Clean URLs** — `.htaccess` mod_rewrite strips `.html` (301 to the clean URL, internal
  rewrite back to the file). Internal links use extensionless paths.

### Production Deployment

1. **Build production files**

   ```bash
   npm run build   # from the repo root → runs build.sh
   ```

2. **Output** — the deployable site is generated in `dist/` (prerendered HTML + hashed
   `/_app/*` assets + static passthrough).

3. **Deploy** — upload the contents of `dist/` to your web server's `public_html/` directory.
   Ensure `.htaccess` is included for clean URLs, CSP headers, and caching.

### File Permissions (cPanel)

| Type        | Permission | Numeric |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Files       | rw-r--r--  | 644     |
| Directories | rwxr-xr-x  | 755     |

## Multi-language Support (i18n)

The site supports three languages, powered by **i18next / react-i18next**. Translation
resources live in [`web/src/locales/`](web/src/locales/) (`en.json`, `fil.json`, `ceb.json`)
and are consumed through the `useLanguage()` hook's `t()` function. Any key missing in the
active language automatically falls back to English.

| Language | Code  | Status                                                                |
| -------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| English  | `en`  | Complete                                                              |
| Filipino | `fil` | Complete                                                              |
| Cebuano  | `ceb` | Starter set (high-visibility UI; remaining keys fall back to English) |

## Recent Changes

### v1.2.0 — Full migration to Vite + React + TypeScript

- **Rebuilt the entire site** from the vanilla static-HTML pages and the thin Next.js
  `react-app/` island into a **single Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui**
  application in `web/`, statically prerendered by `vite-react-ssg`. The legacy static site and
  `react-app/` were removed; the repo root now holds only static passthrough merged into
  `dist/` by `build.sh`.
- **Faithful design-token port** — legacy `style.css` design tokens mapped onto Tailwind
  `@theme` + shadcn tokens; self-hosted Inter (no Google Fonts CDN); lucide icons.
- **Content-parity pass** — audited ~30 migrated routes against the legacy site and restored
  every dropped section (Budget/Transparency, Statistics, Government/Officials, Legislative,
  Public Safety, Home, and more).
- **Homepage "Feel Mati" revamp** — new hero with service search, "Rising in Mati", "Mati at a
  Glance", tourism, City Services, and a Public Funds panel driven by the real BLGF SRE data;
  Pujada-navy + Feel-Mati-amber palette with Plus Jakarta Sans + IBM Plex Mono (self-hosted).
- **Navigation refinement** — active-state pill, tightened sizing/spacing, plain-white header.
- **Framer Motion** — subtle, reduced-motion-aware homepage animation: section scroll-reveals,
  hero entrance stagger, grid-card stagger, and Public Funds bars that fill on view.
- **Tooling** — Vitest + Testing Library, Playwright (cross-browser), Lighthouse CI, oxlint,
  Prettier, and `tsc` type-checking.

- Added "Install App" prompt banner using the `beforeinstallprompt` API with Install/Dismiss buttons, respecting standalone mode and session dismissal
- Replaced manual-refresh update flow with seamless `skipWaiting` + `controllerchange` auto-reload pattern
- Service worker now accepts `SKIP_WAITING` message from clients to activate waiting worker on demand
- Install banner goes full-width (no border-radius, no margins) on mobile viewports (<=575px) with slide-up animation
- Created `PWAManager` component handling both install prompt and SW update lifecycle

#### Footer Mobile Alignment

- Added `text-align: center` for `.footer-tagline` in the <=575px mobile breakpoint, overriding the tablet `text-align: left` rule

#### Responsive Header & Hotline Marquee

- Standardized header vertical spacing (padding, min-height, logo size) across desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints
- Raised tablet breakpoint from 991px to 1024px to properly capture iPad Pro portrait and iPad Air landscape
- Converted the emergency hotline bar into a clickable scrolling marquee on tablet and mobile viewports (≤1024px) with pause-on-hover/focus for accessibility

#### Progressive Web App (PWA)

- Rewrote `sw.js` with dual-cache architecture: `STATIC_CACHE` (precached app shell) and `RUNTIME_CACHE` (dynamic content, 80-item FIFO, 7-day TTL)
- Navigation uses network-first with offline fallback; static assets use stale-while-revalidate; data/API uses network-first with cache fallback
- Upgraded `manifest.webmanifest` with maskable icons, app shortcuts, and iOS PWA meta tags
- Fixed theme-color to brand blue (#0032a0) across all files

#### Automatic Version Management

- Created cross-platform `scripts/bump-version.js` (Node.js) replacing the bash-only `version.sh`
- Version bump updates `version.json`, `package.json`, HTML files, and the React app
- Git pre-commit hook auto-bumps patch version on every commit (skips version-only commits)

#### Code Quality & Tooling

- Installed Prettier with project-wide configuration and a pre-commit format hook
- Resolved all npm vulnerabilities

### Earlier (static-HTML era)

- Added Mati Quiz CTA and footer link; added the Brief History of Mati interactive timeline (1760–1957)
- Upgraded translation coverage across English / Filipino / Cebuano with English fallback
- Standardized copyright and footer across all pages; updated year to 2026
- Removed `.html` extensions from navigation links (clean URLs via `.htaccess`)
- Tuned `build.sh` excludes and CSP headers for production
