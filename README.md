# BetterMati.org

A civic-tech portal that gives the people of Mati, Davao Oriental, Philippines plain-language access to their City Government's services, officials, legislation and public funds.

> ### ⚠️ Records still waiting on verified City of Mati data
>
> BetterMati.org started from a template built for LGU Solano and has been rebranded to the City of Mati: name, domain, geography (`PH-DAO`), terminology (City / Sangguniang Panlungsod) and artwork. Much of the content is now sourced and checked (see [Data sources](https://bettermati.org/transparency/sources)), but these records are still **clearly-marked placeholders** (`[Placeholder]`, `[TODO]` or `_status: "draft"`) until the City confirms them:
>
> - **Elected officials** — `data/officials.json` is a draft (`_status: "draft"`), so officials are left out of site search until confirmed.
> - **Barangays** — the 26 barangays and their populations are verified (`data/mati/`); barangay captains and contacts are not.
> - **Legislation** — `data/ordinances.json` and `data/resolutions.json` list titles only; full texts are pending.
> - **Office contacts** — City Hall and office phone numbers and emails need confirmation from the City. (Emergency hotlines in `data/emergency-hotlines.json` are transcribed from the City DRRMO's official graphic.)
> - **Tourism** — some attraction details in `data/tourism.json` are placeholders.
> - **Audit reports** — COA Annual Audit Reports are not yet collected (Full Disclosure reports are).
> - **Config** — the Google Analytics ID is a placeholder; set your GA4 property.
> - **Cebuano (`ceb`)** — `web/src/locales/ceb.json` is a partial, machine-assisted set; missing strings fall back to English pending translation and native review.
>
> Verified facts are tracked as BM-001. Don't "correct" them from general knowledge.

## Live Site

## Technology Stack

The site is a single **React + TypeScript** application built with **Vite** and prerendered to static HTML, so it runs on any static host or cPanel with no server runtime.

## Architecture

The project is a **single Vite + React SSG application** in [`web/`](web/), plus **static passthrough** files at the repo root that the build merges into the final output.

- **`web/`** — the whole site: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui. Every route is statically prerendered to HTML by `vite-react-ssg`. Routes are code-split, so each page loads only its own code.
- **[`web/migrated-routes.json`](web/migrated-routes.json)** — the source of truth for the live routes. It drives the prerender set, the build's folder pass, and `AppLink`'s SPA-vs-full-load decision.
- **[`web/src/lib/siteIndex.ts`](web/src/lib/siteIndex.ts)** — the Site index data that feeds both `/sitemap` and site-wide search.
- **`data/`** — JSON content feeds, imported at build time (except `news.json`, which is fetched at runtime so news can change without a rebuild).
- **Root static passthrough** — `assets/` (images), `data/`, `admin/` (news editor), `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `.htaccess`, `offline.html`, `robots.txt` and the `403/404/500.html` error pages.
- **[`build.sh`](build.sh)** (`npm run build` at the repo root) — builds `web/`, assembles the prerendered HTML and hashed bundles (`/_app/*`) with the passthrough files into **`dist/`**, moves parent routes to `<route>/index.html` so Apache directories don't shadow them, generates `sitemap.xml`, and sets cPanel file permissions.
- **Clean URLs** — `.htaccess` mod_rewrite strips `.html`, so internal links use extensionless paths.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaarlosasiang/bettermaticity.git
cd bettermaticity/web
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version         | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js     | v20 (`.nvmrc`)  | App tooling and package management                       |
| npm         | v10+            | Dependency management                                    |
| Git         | Latest          | Version control                                          |
| Python 3    | v3.x (optional) | `serve.py`, for previewing the built `dist/` and testing |

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaarlosasiang/bettermaticity.git
   cd bettermaticity
   ```

2. **Install app dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser** — http://localhost:5173

> Production builds, Playwright and Lighthouse run from the **repo root**, which has its own `npm install`.

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run build`                            | Full production build via `build.sh` → `dist/` (bumps the patch version)       |
| `npm run build -- --no-bump`               | Build without changing the version                                             |
| `npm run build:minor` / `build:major`      | Bump that level, then build                                                    |
| `npm run release [-- minor\|patch\|major]` | Bump the version and draft its `data/changelog.json` entry from recent commits |

To preview a production build with clean URLs working, serve it with `serve.py`, which emulates the `.htaccess` rewrites:

```bash
python3 serve.py -d dist -p 8888
```

### Production Deployment

1. **Build** — `npm run build` from the repo root (runs `build.sh`).
2. **Output** — the deployable site is in `dist/` (prerendered HTML, hashed `/_app/*` bundles and the static passthrough).
3. **Deploy** — upload the contents of `dist/` to your server's `public_html/`, including `.htaccess` for clean URLs, security headers and caching.

Build-time settings come from an optional, git-ignored root `.env`: `VITE_SITE_URL` sets the canonical origin used in page metadata and `sitemap.xml` (default `https://bettermati.org`). See `.env.example`.

### File Permissions (cPanel)

| Type        | Permission | Numeric |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Files       | rw-r--r--  | 644     |
| Directories | rwxr-xr-x  | 755     |

`build.sh` sets these for you.

## Multi-language Support (i18n)

Powered by **i18next / react-i18next**. Translations live in [`web/src/locales/`](web/src/locales/) as flat key files and are read through the `useLanguage()` hook's `t()`. Any key missing in the chosen language falls back to English.

| Language | Code  | Status                                                        |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| English  | `en`  | Complete                                                      |
| Cebuano  | `ceb` | Partial (about 15% of strings); the rest fall back to English |

## What's New

**1.9.0** added a Transparency section (City finances FY2021–FY2025, projects and procurement, Full Disclosure reports, official documents, data sources and methodology), separate pages for officials, offices and barangays, an Official links page, site-wide search, an About page, a Site index, and faster page loads through code splitting.

Every release is listed in plain language at [bettermati.org/changelog](https://bettermati.org/changelog), from [`data/changelog.json`](data/changelog.json).

## Contributing

Developers, designers, data researchers, writers, translators and residents of Mati are all welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, checks and project rules, and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before taking part.

Short version: work inside `web/`, run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` there, run `npm run format` at the root, and open a pull request. Data changes need an official source.
